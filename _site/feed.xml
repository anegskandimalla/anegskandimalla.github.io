<p>Cyanide Cinema is a web app that predicts how much a movie will get pirated by using a Tensorflow binary classification alongside GPT to generate a detailed text report.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems the moderators did not like data science projects, so we didn’t win anything. Next year, we plan on making a game!</p>

<p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.</p>

<p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>

<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>

<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>

<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>

<p>If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!</p>]]></content><author><name>r3sgame</name><email>r3s.softlocke@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Science" /><category term="Games" /><category term="Software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toshiba Exploravision is an annual science competition where high schoolers from all around the United States compete to propose research and product ideas.

<h2 id="our-idea">Our Idea</h2>
<p>My team decided to create an invention that would address plastic pollution: the Plastican! We proposed that it would contain an engineered chemical that would be designed to degrade plastic bags and other common consumer items. After several months of writing and presenting, we were able to submit the final paper to the competition portal.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>Turns out, we actually received an honorable mention! For this achievement, everyone in the group received a certificate along with a very cool wooden robot (definitely not for promotional purposes).</p>
