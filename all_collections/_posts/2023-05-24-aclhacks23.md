## Background
Academies Hacks is an annual hackathon held at the Academies of Loudoun. This year's theme was pirates, and we came up with a machine learning application (that should have won).

## Cyanide Cinema
Cyanide Cinema is a web app that predicts how much a movie will get pirated by using a Tensorflow binary classification alongside GPT to generate a detailed text report.

Unfortunately, it seems the moderators did not like data science projects, so we didn't win anything. Next year, we plan on making a game!
