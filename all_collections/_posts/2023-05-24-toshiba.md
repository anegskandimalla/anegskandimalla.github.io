## Background
Toshiba Exploravision is an annual science competition where high schoolers from all around the United States compete to propose research and product ideas. If you would like to know more about this opportunity, visit this link: [Toshiba Exploravision Homepage](https://exploravision.org)

## Our Idea
My team decided to create an invention that would address plastic pollution: the Plastican! We proposed that it would contain an engineered chemical that would be designed to degrade plastic bags and other common consumer items. After several months of writing and presenting, we were able to submit the final paper to the competition portal.

## The Result
Turns out, we actually received an honorable mention! For this achievement, everyone in the group received a certificate along with a very cool wooden robot (definitely not for promotional purposes).
